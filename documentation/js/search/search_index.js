used the most popular Ng Bootstrap library to use already created components like: buttons, tabs, texts etc...\nall other stuff were created without any external libs\n\nArchitecture:\nHere I tried to implement the simple architecture what we can improve in the future when if we will evolve oor project.\nAlso I created the reusable components what can be used in all places of our app.\nOf course here present only 1 module, but if it will be necessary we can create separated modules for each future section and use the Lazy loading to improve the App speed\nAnd for now here we don't have Angular SSR implement because it is not needed at this stage of the project\nStyles:\nI used the SCSS preprocess like default one in the project because with this one we can simply create the variables and mixins and reuse them in all our components.\nAlso SCSS has the cascade structure that improve reading the code and helps to avoid overriding the another parts of App.\nFor Responsive Web Design I used the standard Media Queries to fit the App for small screens\nTo start the project in dev mode, use:\nnpm install\nng serve / npm start\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
